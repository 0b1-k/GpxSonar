GPXSonar is a program designed for Pocket PC geocachers who need to take GeoCaching.com Pocket Queries with them in the field. Its ultimate goal is to allow for 'zero-paper' geocaching.

.View, search, filter and merge lists of geocaches.
.Export waypoints to a variety of formats.
.Log a cache in the field.
.Generate reports.
.Manage travel bugs in and out of caches.
.Track the trade of geoswag.
.Manage your own caches.
.Read waypoints from zipped files.

GPXSonar is freeware but donations are encouraged. Please visit http://gpxsonar.homeip.net for updates.
